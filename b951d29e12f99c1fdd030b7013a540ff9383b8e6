{"timestamp":"1467161400","reviewRef":"refs/pull/2/head","targetRef":"refs/heads/master","requester":"ojarjur","description":"Fix a bug in the support for browsers requiring polyfills.\n\nThe web UI requires web-components in order work, and not all\r\nbrowsers support them fully yet. This was supposed to be worked\r\naround by using the 'webcomponents-lite.min.js' library, but\r\nthat work-around was not properly implemented.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, there was no sequencing of the calls to the\r\n'Polymer' function to ensure that they happened after the\r\nweb components library was loaded. The result was that the\r\n'Polymer' function would be called before the web components\r\nlibrary was loaded, that name would not yet be defined, and\r\nas a result the UI would completely fail to load.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes that by not allowing the initial calls to\r\nthe 'Polymer' function to happen until after the web components\r\nlibrary has finished loading.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #1... or, at least, makes the UI work in the latest version of Firefox (I haven't tested Edge or Safari yet).
